# Transformer

This repo is to learn and implement the Transformer first described [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf).

## Getting Started
Navigate to `data` folder and execute `python download.py`. This code downloads and extracts the [Europarl](https://www.statmt.org/europarl/) dataset (English-German). Once the process is done, you should be able to see the two txt files in corresponding languages.
